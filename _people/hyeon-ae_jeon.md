I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Cognitive Science at Seoul National University in 2007. Following a postdoctoral fellowship at Neuroscience Research Institute in Korea, I moved to Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany and worked as a research scientist until 2016. I joined Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences in DGIST in September, 2016. I am also a principal investigator of Partner Group of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences at the Department for Brain and Cognitive Sciences, DGIST.

[Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) runs the Kording lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
Konrad is trying to foster an environment of creativity in which important problems get
solved in interesting ways and unimportant problems get solved in fun ways.
Konrad believes in the role of playful approaches towards science.
He also believes that ultimately we need to solve important medical problems.
His lab focuses on Big Data approaches to neuroscience and really anything. Massive amounts of data
exist in neuroscience and work in the lab is focused on making sense out of such datasets (and obtaining such sets).
